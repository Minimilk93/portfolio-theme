1.0.3:
    - Using gulp-clean-css instead of gulp-minify-css.
    - Removing .bowerrc and using default path (bower_components) because installing from the backend does not include this file and compilation of assets will fail.
    - Using pump in gulpfile.js for better error handling/display.
    - Now the JS compilation uses Babel (es2015 preset) to avoid Unexpected character errors.
    - New "gulp clean" command to delete old CSS and JS files. This command will delete the entire assets/js and assets/css folders.
1.0.2:
    - Fixed gulp watch.
1.0.1:
    - Fixed the order foundation.core.js should be in app.js.
    - Fixed the font-awesome path.
1.0.0:
    - Initial Oktober Foundation theme with Gulp-built frontend resources.
    - Based on Zurb Foundation 6.2.3
